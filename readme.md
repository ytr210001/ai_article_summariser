# Build and Deploy ChatGPT AI SaaS Business with React


## Introduction
This repo has all the files required to make an Article Summarizer Application using OpenAI's GPT model.
 
In the process of building this application I've: 
- setup a ReactJS project using Vite
- created a responsive, beautiful UI/UX with a nice touch of glass morphism using Tailwind CSS
- made advanced RTK query API requests that fire on condition
- saved history using the local storage
- handled form events and catch errors
- implemented copy to clipboard
